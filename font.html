            Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently contain hypertext links 
            that allow related pages to be retrieved. HTML is the markup language for encoding Web pages. 
            It was designed by the British scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear physics laboratory in Switzerland
            during the 1980s. HTML markup tags specify document elements such as headings, paragraphs, and tables.
            They mark up a document for display by a computer program known as a Web browser. The browser interprets the tags,
            displaying the headings, paragraphs,and tables in a layout that is adapted to the screen size and fonts available to it.
